The text is a framework for handling investor grievances received through SCORES by entities and monitoring the redressal process by designated bodies.

According to the framework, entities receiving complaints through SCORES must review their grievance redressal mechanism and resolve the complaint within 21 calendar days. The complaint will be automatically forwarded to the concerned entity for resolution and submission of an Action Taken Report (ATR) within the same timeframe. The complaint will also be forwarded to the relevant Designated Body, which will ensure that the entity submits the ATR within 21 calendar days. The Designated Body will monitor the ATRs submitted by entities and provide feedback for improvement if necessary. SEBI may also monitor the grievance redressal process by entities and Designated Bodies.

If the complainant is satisfied with the resolution provided by the entity or does not request a review, the complaint will be disposed of. However, if the complainant is not satisfied or the entity does not submit the ATR within the stipulated time, the Designated Body will take cognizance of the complaint for a first review. The Designated Body may seek clarification from the entity and the entity must provide clarification within the specified timeline. The Designated Body will then submit the revised ATR to the complainant within 10 calendar days.

The complainant may request a second review of the complaint within 15 calendar days of the submission of the ATR by the Designated Body. If the complainant is satisfied with the ATR or does not request a review, the complaint will be disposed of. If the complainant is not satisfied or the Designated Body does not submit the ATR within 10 calendar days, SEBI may take cognizance of the complaint for a second review. SEBI may review the complaint with the stakeholders involved and the entity or Designated Body must take immediate action and submit a revised ATR to SEBI within the specified timeline.

The text also includes provisions for SCORES authentication for registered intermediaries, market infrastructure institutions, and companies intending to list their securities on recognized stock exchanges. It outlines the procedure for obtaining SCORES authentication and the responsibilities of the entities.

The Designated Bodies must take SCORES authentication from SEBI and have adequate infrastructure/systems in place to comply with the requirements. They must also maintain Management Information Systems (MIS) reports and share them with the concerned entities. SEBI may appoint or remove Designated Bodies for various classes of registered intermediaries.

The text also includes provisions for actions to be taken for failure to redress investor complaints by listed companies. The Designated Stock Exchange may levy fines on the listed company for non-compliance, and if the company fails to redress the grievances and pay the fines, further actions may be taken, including freezing the shareholding of the promoter(s) and initiating other appropriate actions.

The text provides a timeline for the actions to be taken by stock exchanges for non-resolution of investor grievances.
